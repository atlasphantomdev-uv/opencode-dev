# architecture

## Navigation notes

V2: Protocol API → Server handlers → Core SessionV2 → durable SessionInput → SessionExecution/coordinator → Location-scoped runner → LLM. Schema owns shared shapes. Client runtime depends on Schema/Protocol; sdk-next composes Client/Core/Server. Session history and context epochs remain Session-owned. Inspect specs/v2 and existing docs/architecture maps when available. V1 compatibility must be established from executable source and tests; these notes do not assert parity.

These curated notes are review guidance, not automatically verified behavioral claims.
