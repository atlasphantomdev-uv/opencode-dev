# workflows

## Navigation notes

Entry points: CLI: packages/opencode/src/index.ts (yargs); Web: packages/app/src/entry.tsx (Solid/Vite); Desktop: packages/desktop/src/main/index.ts (Electron). CI runs Turbo unit tests, app Playwright tests, generated-client checks and typechecks. Run tests in the affected package; root test intentionally fails. Public API changes require client generation and SDK workflow. Husky pre-push checks Bun and typechecks. Agent context starts at the index, then focused documents and authoritative source.

These curated notes are review guidance, not automatically verified behavioral claims.
